"Based on the comprehensive analysis of the promising AI-related cryptocurrencies 
and the fundâ€™s current holdings and performance, here is the final investment decision:\n\n

### Investment Recommendation:\n

1. **AI Trader Agent (AIT)**\n   
- **Recommendation:** **Buy**\n   
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate. While AIT shows promise with a decent market cap 
and trading volume, it also has high volatility due to fluctuating AI interest.\n   
- **Asset Allocation Proposal:** 20% of the new investment funds.\n   
- **Performance Outlook:** Expected returns over 6-12 months as AI adoption increases, 
potentially yielding a return of 50-100% based on market trends.\n\n
2. **American General Intelligence (AGI)**\n   
- **Recommendation:** **Buy**\n   
- **Risk Assessment:** High. 
Although AGI has upside potential given its unique market position, 
its lower liquidity and market cap can expose investors to sharper price swings.\n   
- **Asset Allocation Proposal:** 15% of the new investment funds.\n   
- **Performance Outlook:** High volatility could result in significant swings, 
with potential returns of 100-200% over the next 6-12 months.\n\n

3. **BoltAI (BOLTAI)**\n   
- **Recommendation:** **Hold**\n   
- **Risk Assessment:** Very High. 
Current price levels suggest substantial losses. 
Hold for potential recovery but monitor closely.\n   
- **Asset Allocation Proposal:** 10% 
(considering sell-off if performance does not improve in 3 months).\n   
- **Performance Outlook:** Long-term recovery could bring growth, 
but in the short term, it may not yield good returns.\n\n

4. **Shr00m (SHR00M)**\n   
- **Recommendation:** **Sell**\n   
- **Risk Assessment:** High. 
Weak performance and low market interest suggest it's unlikely to recover significantly.\n   
- **Asset Allocation Proposal:** 0% (consider cutting losses and reallocating funds).\n   
- **Performance Outlook:** Projected to remain stagnant or decline further in the short to medium term.\n\n

5. **Homo Memetus (HOMO)**\n   
- **Recommendation:** **Hold**\n   
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate. 
While it has shown strong recent performance, maintain vigilance for signs of volatility 
as it is still a relatively small player.\n   
- **Asset Allocation Proposal:** 25% across the new funds available.\n   
- **Performance Outlook:** Potential for moderate growth (30-50%) over 6-12 months 
if current trends continue.\n\n

6. **Sendor (SENDOR)**\n   
- **Recommendation:** **Hold**\n   
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate. 
Sendor shows decent performance; however, it could be vulnerable to market fluctuations.\n   
- **Asset Allocation Proposal:** 20% across new funds available.\n   
- **Performance Outlook:** Stable growth expected over the next 6-12 months, 
with potential return of 40-70%.\n\n

### Summary of Decisions:\n
- Allocate funds predominantly to AIT and AGI focusing on future trends, 
and reduce exposure to weaker-performing assets like Shr00m. 
Maintain a cautious stance on BoltAI, utilizing it as an observation point for 
recovery potential.\n

- Total recommended allocation of 50% to new AI investments (AIT and AGI), 
with the remaining 50% distributed among current holdings 
(HOMO, SENDOR, reducing exposure of SEH00M, and monitoring BOLTAI).\n  \n

Monitor market performance and reevaluate every quarter, 
ensuring positions are adjusted according to market trends and 
technological advancements in AI.
